# Vermont Car Crash Data Anylysis
A data analysis of car crashes in vermont and predictors of whether they cause injuries, fatalities, or neither.

This project was created as the final project for the Basics of Data Science (CS 2870) course I took while a student at UVM.

The final result of the project can be seen [here](VT_Car_Crash.pdf).

## Author Info
This was a group project. The map, direction of crash graph, and date line graph were created by group members. The graphs following those and
the machine learning was done by me. I wrote the introduction, conclusion, and the limitations sections.
